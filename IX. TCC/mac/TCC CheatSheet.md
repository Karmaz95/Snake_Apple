### Practical Applications of TCC Services

TCC ensures apps can't access private data without approval, which is crucial for security research. Here's why certain services are commonly requested:

- Assistive technologies rely on accessibility permissions to enable features like voice commands.
- Video apps need camera and microphone access for calls or recordings.
- Productivity tools use calendar, contacts, or reminders to sync schedules and people.
- Device integrations, like Bluetooth or motion sensors, support wearables and fitness tracking.
- File-related permissions are vital for apps handling documents, downloads, or network storage.
- Advanced features, such as screen capture or Siri, enhance sharing and voice control in collaborative or automated workflows.

These permissions appear in System Settings under Privacy \& Security, updating dynamically as apps request them.

### Retrieving the Latest TCC Service List

To get an up-to-date list directly from your system (tested on macOS Ventura and later), use these methods. Ensure Terminal has Full Disk Access for queries.

1. **Database Query**:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db "SELECT * FROM access"
sqlite3 /Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db "SELECT * FROM access"
```

This pulls from the user-level / system-level database.

2. **Extract from Framework**:

```bash
strings /System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/TCC.framework/Support/tccd | grep -iEo "^kTCCService.*" | sort -u
```

This scans for service strings in the TCC framework.

### Modifying TCC Permissions via Command Line

TCC stores data in SQLite databases at `~/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` (user-specific) and `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` (system-wide). The key table is `access`, with fields like `service` (permission type), `client` (app bundle ID or path), `client_type` (0 for bundle ID, 1 for path), and `auth_value` (2 for allowed, 0 for denied).

#### Viewing Permissions

List apps with Full Disk Access:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 'SELECT client FROM access WHERE auth_value > 0 AND service = "kTCCServiceSystemPolicyAllFiles"'
```

Check system database similarly.

#### Editing Permissions

- Deny a permission (sets `auth_value` to 0):

```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db 'UPDATE access SET auth_value = 0 WHERE client = "com.example.app" AND service = "kTCCServiceCamera"'
```

- Delete a specific entry:

```bash
sqlite3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db "DELETE FROM access WHERE client = 'com.example.app' AND service = 'kTCCServiceCamera'"
```

- Add an entry (requires code signing requirement blob via `codesign` and `csreq`):
First, extract the blob for the app and target:

```bash
codesign -dr - /Path/To/App.app 2>&1 | awk -F ' => ' '/designated/{print $2}' | csreq -r- -b /tmp/csreq.bin
xxd -p /tmp/csreq.bin | tr -d '\n'  # Output for INSERT
```

Then insert (adapt values accordingly).

For simpler resets, use Apple's `tccutil reset` command to revoke permissions for a service or all for an app `tccutil reset All com.apple.Terminal`.
